```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Required Packages (will update if additional are needed)
*  `tidyverse`
*  `httr`
*  `jsonlite`

# Functions

right now, this is just the spot where I'm testing out calling the api. Will replace this with a function later.

```{r testCall, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)

resp <- GET("https://api.covid19api.com/countries")
str(resp) #shows that the data is in content as a raw vector like in hw4

resPretty <- as_tibble(fromJSON(rawToChar(resp$content)))
head(resPretty, 10)
```
